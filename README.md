 ## Installation
 <a href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm">MARS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases">Logisim-evolution</a> are the two software I am going to use to demonstrate examples or technical contents.
You can download the Logisim-evolution (latest releases) from:
```
https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases
```
For windows users, you can download the ...-all.jar, and Mac users can download the ... .dmg file.
